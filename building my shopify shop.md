Day 1 -- Friday

After taking a look at some stores for sale, I couldn't
afford any of the ones I wanted, so I decided to take
matters into my own hands and create my own Shopify
store.

Created a new store, added Oberlo app to find products,
stayed up until 2am adding and importing products.

At this point I already had a domain registered that
I wasn't using which was a pretty good fit for the
name, but I didn't have any images to use.

Day 2 -- Saturday

After sleeping, logged back into my store only to have
the sad realization that I'd imported products the
wrong way and was missing a bunch of variant, spent
quite a few hours adding more products, looking for
the things I wanted and re-importing products I'd
imported the wrong way.

Wanted to add a theme to improve the look of the site
but also wanted to save money so went for a free
theme. I added some stock images to the slideshow,
and some of the default colours. It's still looking
largely un-customised but it's a start.

Created a FaceBook page for my new venture, added an
Instagram account and did more product editing.

Day 3 - Sunday

I had to go out for the day but I got some editing
done via the mobile app. Not much progress today.
Made some menu changes.
